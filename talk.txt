RequireJS
* Implements AMD, aims to be reference spec, try to cover the most cases.
* almond, an AMD API shim, great for builds, 1KB minified/gzipped.

In PhoneGap

* phonegap.js uses AMD for their wrapping

    * require.js: multiple views, staged loading. The best performance is not loading JS.
* loader plugins for env.
* Skip build deploys.
